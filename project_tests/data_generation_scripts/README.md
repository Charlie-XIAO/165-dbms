Example instructions for how to generate some data for all milestones. You may need to change the scale of the data in the shell script etc.

```bash
./gen_all_for_staff_use.sh ~/repo/cs165-docker-test-runner/test_data
```

This will generate some `*.csv`, `*.dsl` and `*.exp` files in the directory you specified to the shell script.

To run the tests (in Docker), you can pass dsl files directly to your client. 
The following command passes `test00.dsl` file to the client executable and stores the output in `test00.out`:

```bash
./client < test00.dsl > test00.out
```

After successful execution of the above command, you can see the difference between `test00.out` and `test00.exp` using the following command:

```bash
./diff -B -w test00.out test00.exp
```

More information about format of the output generated by the command above can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Side-by-Side.html).
